# My first project in GitHub!
100 days of python prgraming   
Today I officially kicked off my Python programming journey with Angela Yuâ€™s course on Udemy!  
Covered the basics like printing to the console, string manipulation, and simple input/output.   
Already loving how intuitive Python feels! ðŸ”¥
